        <h1>Valt's Redesign Website</h1>
        <p>First, I will create a design layout for what I envision the website to look like. Then, I will work on the syntax of HTML and CSS to get familiarized with how to implement these new features and code. Then, I will create this mock redeisng here before going back into the team's github and creating a new branched redesign website.</p>
