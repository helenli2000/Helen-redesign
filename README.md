# Helen-redesign

## This is my first attempt at making a website using HTML and CSS

I hope by the end of this week, I can get a better idea of the syntax and design process so that I can apply it to the valt's website. 

Here are a list of what I plan on learning this week:
- Main page: add all the features & format it properly
    - Design on Notability (design idea)
- Different redirecting pages
    - Publications
        - Interactive diagram, descritpion/abstract summary
    - People
        - Photo, bio, redirect to their website
    - Directions
    - Future Events and Programs
        - Photo, Brief Description, Calendar View
